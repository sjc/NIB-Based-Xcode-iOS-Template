NIB-Based-Xcode-iOS-Template
============================

A Template for Xcode 5 for creating iPhone, iPad or universal applications with a NIB-based root view controller

New projects created by recent versions of Xcode have by default used storyboards. Using this template, you can start a project with something closer to the old NIB-based Xcode templates. This template creates a project with a UIViewController subclass with NIB file (or two -- an ~iphone and an ~ipad -- for universal projects).

To use the template, copy "NIB-based Application.xctemplate/" to ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/<Something>/, where <Something> can be any name you like. When you select File > New > Project... in Xcode, you should see <Something> listed on the left under iOS.
